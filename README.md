## User Stories
[to the top](https://github.com/ScoRoc/DoshTracker#ryde)

1. As a Bartender, I am used to grabbing a drink after work and buying my food at work. But even with my discounts I tend to spend 20-40 dollars everytime I work 5 days a week. I am finding that the money I bring home isn't quite enough.
2. I am Ashley and I am a stripper in Las Vegas and with my late nights I find I tend to spend my tips and cash everyday. It becomes hard to keep track what I am making during a shift and how much I should claim in taxes at the end of the year.

## About the project

DoshTracker was originally inspired because my previous jobs as a bartender and server have made me realize that when people make money as cash instead of a check, it can be hard to track. It is not like you can take a picture of the cash and it goes into a bank. I have seen many friends struggle to make ends meet because they spend the cash they make. Not realizing that that cash is there main income and needs to be saved not spent.
